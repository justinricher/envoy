Contents
================================
This package contains Java and C# examples.

Java Examples:

  - Envoy API
	  - CS1one
	  - F400
	  - F510
	  - F53
	  - SCN
	  - SCR

  - JavaPOS API
	  - F53JavaPOS
	  - JetsortJavaPOS
	  - RCDJavaPOS

C# Examples:

  - F53
  - SCN

NOTE: The C# support is provided by IKVM (ikvm.net), and is a 1:1 approximation
of the Java Envoy API.  For both the Java and C# APIs, please consult the
JavaDocs included in the Envoy installation and the Envoy Programmer's Guide
located at the ARCA Developer Portal (http://developer.arca.com/envoy).



Before Running the Examples
================================
All Envoy-based applications require a running Envoy Service in order to
function.  Confirm that the Envoy Service is running on your system for best
results.

Some examples require that a device already be registered for the
example to run properly. If so, confirm that the target device is registered
using the EnvoyHome application. For example requirements, see the JavaDoc
comment above the example class definition.

On Windows, the Envoy Service is a Windows Service.  On Linux, the service can
be started, stopped, and restarted using Upstart's start/stop/restart commands.
See the Envoy Programmer's Guide (http://developer.arca.com/envoy) for more
details on Upstart commands.



Java Example Instructions
================================
Note: The Java examples are expected to be compiled with a Java 8 compiler.

The Envoy API examples require only the LibEnvoyAPI JAR file. The JavaPOS API 
examples also require LibJavaPOSAPI and jpos114 JAR files. You can find these
JAR files in the Envoy installation directory.


Compilation
----------------

To compile an Envoy example Java program on Windows, issue the following 
command in a command prompt window:

  javac -cp .;LibEnvoyAPI.jar src\com\arca\envoy\example\<example>.java

To compile an Envoy example Java program on Linux, issue the following command
in a terminal window:

  javac -cp .:LibEnvoyAPI.jar src/com/arca/envoy/example/<example>.java
  
Note: To compile a JavaPOS example, add LibJavaPOSAPI.jar and jpos114.jar to
the classpath argument.


Execution
----------------
As stated above, ensure the Envoy service is running before running an example.

Due to the package name used in the examples, move into the src directory 
before running the example:

  cd src

To execute an example Java program on Windows, issue the following command in a
command prompt window:

  java -cp .;..\LibEnvoyAPI.jar com.arca.envoy.example.<example-class-name>

To execute an example Java program on Linux, issue the following command in a
terminal window:

  java -cp .:../LibEnvoyAPI.jar com.arca.envoy.example.<example-class-name>

Note: To execute a JavaPOS example, add LibJavaPOSAPI.jar and jpos114.jar to
the classpath argument.



C# Example Instructions
================================
Full steps for building the C# applications are provided in the Envoy
Programmer's Guide (http://developer.arca.com/envoy).
